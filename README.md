<br/>

I'm interested in high-performance search algorithms, parallel tree search, bitboard game representations, message-passing architectures, self-play reinforcement learning, and making strong AIs for imperfect information two-player games — especially stacking / falling-block games.

I'm also the developer of the live-service competitive block stacker, [God of Stackers](https://godofstackers.com/about). Interested in the game? Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7qK8ZyZCH2)!

Currently most active on:

- Parallel search algorithms with advanced load-balancing approaches
- Statistical, Monte Carlo and ML approaches to problems in game theory
- Project managing and developing God of Stackers

## 🌟 Current Projects
